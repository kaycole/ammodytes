# The role of Ammodytes (dubius and americanus) in the Northeast US food web

We set out to investigate the role of Ammodytes dubius and Ammodytes americanus in the Northeast US food web. This section of the project focuses on the role of Ammodytes in predator fish diets. We accomplished this through a literature review and a diet analysis. The data used in this analysis were supplied by the [NOAA NMFS NEFSC Food Web Dynamics Program](https://www.nefsc.noaa.gov/femad/pbb/fwdp/).
